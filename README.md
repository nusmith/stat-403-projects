# stat-403-projects

This repo contains HW assignments from Stat 403, Resampling Inference

HW7 contains two problems, which analyze R's built-in iris and admissions datasets. I use empirical, residual, wild, and parametric BT methods to estimate the distributions of these datasets and compare the standard error acorss different methods.
